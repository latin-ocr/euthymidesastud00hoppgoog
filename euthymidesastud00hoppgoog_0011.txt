PREFACE.

The work of collecting the following material has been asomewhat
laborious process partly from the fact that owing to the unsatisfactory
condition of most of the plates previously published‚ Iwas obliged, in
order to obtain more satisfactory conclusions, to have a large number of
vases photographed. Ol the seven plates here published‚ land ΙΙ are
from drawings made by Mr. Leonhard of Munich and III-VII from pho-
tograph drawings made by Mr. F. Anderson of the British Museum. Itis
unfortunate that this process in the case of the last could not entirely do
away with the effect of the foreshortening, but as all the details are given
with great care, it is hoped that they will be found adequate. lhere
take an opportunity of thanking both gentlemen for the careful and pains-
taking way, in which they have done the work.

The four vases are here published for the first time. The text illu·
strations 1 have added, to show some of the details on the two Munich
amphoras 378 and 410, as the plates in the Auserlesene Vasenbilder are
practically useless. It did not however seem necessary to have both vases
re=drawn The obverse of the British Museum amphora E 256 has been

alreadylpublished in the third volume of their Vase Catalogue‚ so l have

refrained from reprinting the same.
