EUTHYMIDES.

Before the Persian wars had made havoc with the various Athenian
industries we find that no guild was in a more flourishing condition than
, that ol the potters, if we may so judge lrom the number os names we ’
have ol those who signed their work. Moreover the quality of the work
they placed on the market was ol superior excellence. The study of this

. period ol Greek ceramology, il I may use the term, has increased of late

years to a great extent, and the work of most of the artists who formed
a group around Euphronios has been careiully scrutinized and the stylistic
Α difference between them established. Among these artists‚ however, one,
. up to the present moment, has'lailed to receive the position he ought to
hold, and that is Euthymides. The scantine'ss ol the work he has left us
may perhaps account for this in a measure3 still, such work as we have
shows us that in point ol technical skill he will bear comparison with such ,
names as Euphronios, Hieron, Brygos and DouriS, and Ι hope that in

Ϊν the following pages I shall succeed in giving him his due.

I. propose to divide this work into three parts: first to the study of
such material ol his the authenticity of which is unquestionable; secondly, to
a discussion of vases, which in my opinion are salsely assigned to him,
and lastly to investigate those vases which have been assigned to him by
others, and to bring lorward some new material now assigned to him lor
the first time.
