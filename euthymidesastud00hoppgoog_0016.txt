These five vases are all which uzu be asigned to Euthymides beyond
questiony since all hear hin signamre. The condition os the material leaves
much to be desired, since os the five„ three only (Β, D and E) are in really
good condition. A is so sragmenmry as to be almost worthlss and C
has been defaced to a grat extent by fire. The two Munieh amphoras
however form an absolute and valuable standpoint.

So much for our material, which as we have said, is extremely
scanty. Here however we are on firm ground, but no sooner do we under-
tnke the task os sormulating his style and by means os it assign to him
other unsigned vases, than we find ourselves in difficulties at once. It
inereases them to find that Phintias, another potter os the Euphmnian cycle,
has a style so similar to that os Euthymides that hardly a single attri-
bution of unsigned vases to either os these artists has passed unchallenged,
and there are at least half a dozen vases which are assigned to Phintias
by some archaeologists and to Euthymides by others. It seems to me
however that the task ofaccurately determining the style of either mist, need
not be such a difficult one provided the method be correct; the conflict
os opinions asise rather from misinterpretations and sailures to thoroughly
understand what the artist's meaning is. Over reliance on mere details is
responsible to a great degree l'or all the divergent opinions, for, it must
be remembered that the whole cycle of Euphronios was conventional to
the last degree and that there are few detailed characteristics of any one
muster which cannot be duplicated among hals a dozen others. Also the
fact that no one master has left us more than a limited number os vases,
precludes us from formulating definite rules as to the shape os the foot,
the work of the hair. the form os the eye and numerous other details,
osten cited to prove a case in point. To a certain extent such facts are
vnluuble, but they ought not to bear the weight os the whole argument.
All the great potters had an individuality ol their own which expresoed
itself iu more than mere details, and it is this ‘inner meaning’ os Euthy—
mides' work that 1 hope to he able to make plain in the course of
this article.
