His relation to Euphronius.

The r. f. technique had under the hands of Epiktetos and his set
freed itself from the earlier b. f. influence and started out on its own pe·
culiar path. Though we speak of an Epiktetan and a Euphronian cycle,
it must not be supposed that they are necessarily distinct as far as time
goes. Hardly more than forty years elapsed from the beginning of the
r. f. technique to its developement by Euphronios at the height of his
activity, and Kachrylion who is generally acknowledged as belonging to
the end of the Epiktetan cycle was a contemporary of Euphronios' Hart-
wig⁵ assigns the beginning of Euphronios' activity to 500 B. C. and Furt-
wangler⁶ to the last decade of the preceding century, about 510 B. C.
There is no need to repeat the arguments involved in the discussi0n; both
Hartwig's and F urtw'angler’s dates seem to me far more satisfactory than
Studniczka'57. The gradual tendency of late years has been to push back
the date of the Euphronian cycle and the discovery of the Acropolis frag-
ments has tended to confirm the early dates We may assign an ap·
proximate date for Euthymides with a fair amount of certainty, through
his relation to the Epiktetan cycle, his reference to Euphronios and his use
of the love name. The first point may be better discussed later after we
have learned to know what his style is. As to the second point I am
aware that his mention of Euphronios may be interpreted in two different
ways. We found on the obverse of E the inscription “Eridupibng ἔγραψε
ὁ Πολίου” and on the reverse “ug οὐδέποτε Εὐφρόνιος.” Now this might
either point to the self complacent novice who taught by the master

ι Euphronios wished to surpass him, if only in his own estimation, or else

(which to my mind seems more probable) to the master who viewing with
alarm his rival's progress tries to crush him at one blow. This last sup·
position altera comparison of the styles of the two artists becomes almost
a certainty. Euphronius is progressive to the last degree, and the most
marked difference exists between the Petersburg Hetairae psykter and the
Berlin polychrome kylix. ln the case of Euthymides, judging, at least, from
