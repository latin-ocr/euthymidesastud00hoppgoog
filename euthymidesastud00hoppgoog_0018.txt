what material we have, no sudi marked progrsssion «zu have existed and
even E his thes-d'oeuvre falls short of Euphronios at h'ss best The close
connection between the two arrisu is apparent enough, but that Euthymida
is the senior seems tairly evident.

This gives us additional material. We απ migr· three to him with
certainty Megakla, Smikyrhos (C) and Phayllos (Β). Further we obtain
the name Leagros from the Berlin krater 2180. which 1 shall show later
is nn unsigned work os his. 1 have no wish tn here renew the discussion
which hu of late raged over the Leagros nzhronologyy nor will it serve
our purpose. The latest autlwrities, especially Furtwfingler and Hartwig
assign the use of this name to Euphronios' early career, and this is simply
another (act which tends to confirm the relationship between the two artists.
Though this name occurs on a vase which we attribute to Euthymides, it
must be horne in mind that our material is scanty and that because we
have not found it on a signed vase, it does not in the least follow that
he did not use it. He must have signed a larger number of vases we are
ignorant os nt present and may well have used this name. Further we
find this name used by four artists (Kachrylion, Oltcusy Euxitheos and
Euphronius) and it is impossible to say how many more may have sol-
lowed their example.

The name Smikythos has no especial significnnce, but the two others
arc more important. The name Megakles⁸ we find on a hydria of Phin-
tias⁹ in the British Museum. It may be remarked that the common use
os any Love-name by two or more artists never extends overa very long
period, hardly more than a decade. ¹⁰ Hartwig ¹¹ has already established, lo
my mind satisfactorily, that the Love name refers to youths and not to
men. though Wemieke¹¹ declares certainty on this point to be impossible.
