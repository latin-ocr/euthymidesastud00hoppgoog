l do not however think that Hartwig¹³ is justified in discarding the Love-
name altogether as a basis for chronology. We have in Megakles, prob·
¹ ably, the son of Hippokrates, uncle of Perikles and grandfather ofAlkibiades.
Now though the implicit reliance on any given name has caused much
discussion (e. g. the Leagros chronology) yet to assume that in this case
the individual Megakles and the name referred to are one and the same
is perfectly justifiable and not only does not conflict with our evidence
but rather supports it. Jones, Ithink, is right in his basis for the Phin-
tias chronology, in citing the case of Megakles. His arguments need not
be quoted here, but it may suffice so say that from the new Aristotleu
we leam that Megakles, the son of Hippocrates was ostracised in 487 B. C,
and this fact is supported by a tablet ¹⁵ and the Acropolis pinax ¹⁶ which
Ι shall hope to prove, Wernicke¹⁷ to the contrary, is a genuine work of
Euthymides.

The name Phayllosl shall discuss later, when I come to consider
the unsigned work.

His relatton to Phintias.

Before I assign the date I propose to Euthymides, it is well to
establish the relationship between him and Phintias, for'I know of no closer
one existing between any two potters. l have spoken of the great simi·
larity of their work, and from their common use of the Love name Me·
gakles it is certain that they were contemporaries. The natural inference,
seems to me, is that they were partners in the same atelier. Although
. we have no vase signed by the two together, there is nothing to contra-
dict this theory, while a study of the work of both artists seems even to
confirm it. The partnership of potters is extremely common throughout
Greek ceramology, and although of two names on the same vase, one al-
ways refers to the potter himself and the other to the artist, yet the
makers sometimes sign themselves on other vases as artists (e. g.
Euphronios). Now Phintias and Euthymides are both artists; (at least

Ἴ they always sign themselves as such)¹⁸, and Phintias, as we learn from the
