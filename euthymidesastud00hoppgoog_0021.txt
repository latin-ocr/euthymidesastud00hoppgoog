-‘activity,¹ is, as I have said before, practically certain. It would be a per· ,

¹fectly reasonable assumption that he was one of the Metics or Resident ⁹

Nor is this any argument against the partnership we have spoken of, since
Euthymides may well have been a llletic¹ too, there being no means of
proving his Athenian origin. ’

Klein (op. cit p. 192) only mentions four vases signed by Phintias,
but Hartwig (op. cit p. 167) brings the list of signed and attributedvases
up to twenty-three, twelve kylices and eleven other shapes We see by this
that he is chiefly a painter of kylices, not of amphoras. Moreover, with one
exception (Munich 401) his kylices have no outside pictures Hartwig. (op.
cz't p. 196) has I think explained this question satisfactorily. His pecu·
liarities however willbe better discussed later when we contrast him with
his partner.

From what has been said Ι propose to assign the date of¹ 500 B. C.
to Euthymides. This date of course is purely approximate and simply means
that about that time, Euthymides was at the height of his activity. Although
a progression exists in the five vases already referred to, we cannot assign
exact dates to it. The plate A shows that Euthymides is still working
. under the influence of Epiktetos both from its form and the style of its
drawing²². At the same time the amphoras D and E are much more
developed and more in the spirit of the Euphronian cycle, Furthermore
the use of the name Megakles, wh0, as we have seen was ostracised in
487 B. C. If in that year he was prominent enough to be expelled from
, the city, the year 500 might well find him a beautiful youth. Also a

comparison of Euthymides' style with that of Phintias and the other masters ' ,

of the Euphronian cycle, gives us perfect freedom to confine ourselves to
an approximate date like this.

Whether he was a native of Athens is impossible to establish beyond
question, but the probabilities are that if not a citizen of that city, it was

²2 Ι have been unable to see the original, but as far as can be judged from the
drawing the plate is an early work of Euthymides. The plate was a common form of
the Epiktetan cycle and this one shows the characteristics of that time by its form and
circular bordes (the pattern is however new; I do not recall any earlier instance). Further
the lael< of any fainter lines to express details, which as we shall see is so characteristic
of both his and Phintias’ work. For the form ἔγραφε v. Klein p. 13.
