at least the scene of his activity. We know for a certainty that Phintias
worked there, as a kylix signed by him has been discovered on the Acropolis,

and among the vase fragments found there 1 have myself noted fragments
in the style of both masters. The pinax already mentioned, though im·
possible to assign to him absolutely, may well be awork of his. Had
he erected an ex voto on the Acropolis, we need have no uncertainty on
this point. Unfortunately for us, however, we are compelled to resort to
theory in the absence of more definite proof.

Ihave tried to establish the relation between Euthymides and his
contemporaries, to assign him a proper date, *and to discuss his use of the
Love name and partnership with Phintias. It now remains to study his
style and compare it with that of his partner.

Our material, we found, consisted of live vases, of which three only
reward investigation with adequate results. One fact, first of all which
seems to me of especial importance and which greatly facilitates our task
is that Euthymides is in the habit of duplicating his figures on different
vases. The two Hektors on D and E are precisely alike, save that the
artist knew how to vary them a little, as he gave one a pair of greaves
and placed them standing on different legs.

To establish · just what we may consider his style is a difficult task
in view of the fact that he possesses few single peculiarities which distin-
guish him from any other artist of his time. It must however be remem-
bered that his period was characterised by a certain conventionality of
style which left little scope for individuality. In its effect only is the diffe-
rence clear. As far as technique goes we find an extreme fondness for

· emphasizing details (B, D and E) by the use of a faint red paint laid on

very lightly. It is chiefly used for denoting the anatomy of the body, the
folds ol the garment (cf. Hekuba’s chiton on D) and all the various muscles.
The prohiles are pointed and the noses rather «retrousse‘». The contour
of the hair is generally indeed, though in C we find an exception. The
bearded figures have a thin black mustache, leaving the front part of the
lip bare. The glaze is of extreme fineness and brilliancy.

It is in his use of forshortening that his skill is best shown. We
see it especially marked in B, D and E, where the most difficult positions
seem to be perfectly easy to his hand. The attitude of Hektor is a cha-
racteristic one, with one foot to the side and the other seen straight from
the front. The skilful way in which the middle figure on the reverse of
