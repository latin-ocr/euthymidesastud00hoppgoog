below the kolpos The difserence of the material is further denoted by
the chiton’s being represented as transparent (cf. Hektor, Hekuba). The
youths on C, clad only in the himation do not show this, as the lines
of the limbs seen there are merely the “first drawing'', done with a sharp
point as a preliminary sketch before the actual drawing began.

The lines have generally a wavy curve to them, both the heavier
and the sainter, a ripple, so to speak‚ in the lines of the chitonS, and a
roll to those ol the himatia. Is we regard the chlamys held by the figures
on the reverse ol E, we see that the folds are straight only when they '
tall perpendicularly, and wavy whenever the· garment clings to the sorm.
This motive of the chlamys solded over the arm is a savorite one-in ¹Eu-
thymides' work and will be met with frequently. But it is this· peculiar
fashion of treating the himation and chlamys which distinguishes him srorn
all his contemporaries.

It must be stated however beforehand, that, to regard this as an
absolute criterion is rather dangerous. We shall see in the course of this
work, that some vases attributed to him show a treatment of drapery not
exactly similar to the method here described. But while its occurrence
on an unsigned vase is a powersul> argument on its behalf, its absence
ought not to form an absolute ground for rejecting what shows all other
characteristics so strongly.-

If we now compare his work with that os Phintias the similarity is
extremely striking. Both employ the lainter line sor detail: both are skil-

lul at ioreshortening, use the archaic form of the eye, place their ears too ·

high and portray drapery in away impossible in accordance with nature.
In both we find the true archaic stiffness and conventionality. The pal·
mettes used for borders may be found in both alike, their treatment oi
hair is similar and in short, astar as mere outward details gu, any work by
the one might just as well come from the other's hand.

But if we examine the vases more closely we shall find certain in-‘
dividual touches which are unmistakeable and which really distinguish them.
First the work of Phintias on the whole shows more originality-than Eu-
thymides and a little less stereotyped sashion in drawing. His figures are
not so angular, they are broader, more solid and better proportioned, the
outlines firmer and rounder. Phintias gives his figures a firm square ‘head
a nose os the “snub'’ order and a rounded chin with sull lips, while Eu·
thymides inclines to a“relrousse''’ nose and a hard, angular chin. Phintias
