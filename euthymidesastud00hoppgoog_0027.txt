Gerlrard, Trinkschalen und Gefasse, pl. 19, 20) for example. Now though
Euthymides has the full experience of the Epiktetan cycle, it is fair to
assume that his early years coincided with its beginning (since it only
lasted a generation) and it is impossible to believe that the skill he
enjoyed should not have resulted from previous training with some
master. That this master was Andokides is fairly evident; both are al·
most exclusively amphora painters. Though the technique employed by
Andokides is widely different from that of our artist, yet there are many
similarities. Each frames his picture in a border of palmettes, and
chooses a lirnited number of figures, with a tendency to mythological
and heroical subjects. ' There is a decided spirit of harmony and symmetry
in the treatment of the composition, line balancing line. Though actual
comparison is somewhat unsatisfactory, the Berlin amphora may well be
compared with B, for the group of Theseus and Kerykion on the latter
vase shows a decided similarity of treatment. And though at the risk of
anticipating a little, there is a similar resemblance between the r. h. group
of wrestlers on the Berlin vase and that of Theseus and Korone on Munich
410 (I). Further the rape of the tripod is treated in the same fashion as
it is on the British Museum amphora E, 255 (IV) which we shall see ·
belongs in part to Phintias In the face seen from front, we find Ando-
kides also attempting to foreshorten, a thing quite foreign in b. f. work.
Perhaps the greater characteristic of Andokides’ work is his distinct effort
to free himself from old influences and treat his subjects with a greater
naturalness ²⁵.

· To this Euthymides is a worthy successor, and herein lies his
distinction from the cycle of Epiktetos. ln that period force of conven-
tion could no further gu, and none of the artists who represent it, even
towards its end, rise much above the common level. But not so Euthy-
mides; that he was a member of it, A proves, but that is the only trace
of such a connection. In all his other work we see this distinct effort to
rid himself of pure conventionality. Though his figures do lack animation
and his drapery is rather hackneyed, there is no one in the Epiktetan cycle
who approaches him in his ability to foreshorten his figures. That forms
such a prominent feature of his work, and his essays are often so bold,
