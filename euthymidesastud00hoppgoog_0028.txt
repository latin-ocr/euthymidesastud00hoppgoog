that while we may find fault with the drawing, we can only wonder at
the ingenuity which prompted the effort. ⁴

Thus his shortcomings may be lightly regarded, and much pardoned
him. Certain little touches also give us an insight into his character, a
thing difficolt to analyse in most potter’s cases; he is the only one of his
cycle who tells us who his father was, a prece os information common
enough during Nikosthenes’ time, but now out ot date. Furthermore he
took such pleasure and pride in his work, that it got the better of his
modesty. This is shown by such exclamations as “dis οὐδέποτε Εὐφρό-
νιος” οηΕ and “ἔγραφσεν εὖγε mixti* on B. Thus he took care to in-
form the public ol the quality os his work - a curious example of the
ancient idea oi advertising.

Save that A belongs to the Epiktetan cycle, the other four must
belong to the later period. The quality ol the work varies, it is true,
but hardly enough to attempt any chronological arrangement oi them.

1 shall reserve the discussion of the subject matter os his pictures till
the end oi this work, aster all the unsigned vases have been examined.
We shall see however that the underlying principle throughout his work,
is the love to portray the “human form divine'’ in all its various ways,
This was a trait he shared with all the artists ol his time, not only in
vase painting but also in sculpture, sor any one may satisly himself, by a
very superficial study, that the naked human figure is the key·note ol
Greek art during the 6th and 5th centuries.
