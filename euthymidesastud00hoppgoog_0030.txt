on the vase; c he assigns to him on stylistic grounds, but does not 'mention
dat all. .

1 had come to the conclusion independently, that a was not a work
by Euthymides when Ι found my view already expressed by Hartwig who
assigns this vase to Phintias. As far as mere technical details go, the vase
might be by either artist. The heaviness, however, so apparent in Euthy-
mides’ work is here wanting, the protiles are different, and the whole com-
position is decidedly moressanimated than we have found to be the case
on the signed vases Hartwig has already discussed the vase, so I spare
myself the trouble of repetition. But apart from the vase being more in ·
Phintias’ style, the inscriptions would forbid our assigning it to Euthymides.
The Petersburg psykter has the inscription “roi τήνδε lituro& while here we
find “rol τήνδε Ευθυμίδης,“ and it is through the occurrence of this name
on the shoulder and main pictures that the vase has been attributed to
him. In the first placei know of no instance on vases where an artist
signs himself in this fashion. Meier reads Ευθυμίδης eohric* and supplies
ἔγραφσεν, but his suggestion seems to me untenable. To take this as a
dedication, and the name on the main picture as that of the youth is the
more natural supposition. lf we assign this to Phintias the solution becomes
perfectly clear. Phintias here dedicates the vase to his partner. Thus we
’ have here an additional piece of evidence in lavor of the theory I advanced
some time back. Iam quite aware that no instance is actually known of
one artist dedicating his work to another, dedications are used in connec-
tion with a Love·Name. We might consider Euthymides as being here
merely a love name, but let us consider the chain of reasoning a little. We
have a vas'e bearing the name of a potter whose style it somewhat resem-
bles, which we assign to another whose partner we have assumed him to
be. What more natural then, than that Phintias should dedicate this to
him? We found Euphronios name on E, used in a sense certainly not
complimentary, and if such a case occurs (undoubtedly arare one) why
should not the opposite, and a much more likely case, prove true? That
potters used each others names on their vases is here seen to be an actual
fact, so that this theory cannot be contested on that ground. lregard
this solution therefore as the most satisfactory one under the circumstances.

²7 Wernicke, op. cit. p. 117 remarks that potters often signed themselves καλός with
reference to their work; Ι fail to see that this has any connection with the present
inscription and is I think contradicted by the “τοιτήνδε”.
