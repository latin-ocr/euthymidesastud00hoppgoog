, The same holds true ol b3 the inscription²⁸ here is clearly a dedi·
cation and as such cannot be considered as an artist’s signature. Ido not
Ι propose to go so lar as to assign this hydria to any one but simply to
‘point out that it cannot come from Euthymides’ hand. Ι have satisfied myself
on this point after a carelul examination ol the vase, which is in poor con·
dition and has suffered at the restorer's hands. Not only is the execution
extremely poor,'but there is absolutely no signos loreshortening, and no
trace os lainter detail lines. Moreover the shoulder picture is of entirely
different technique. Stiff and conventional as Euthymides’ work is, it cannot
be compared with this vase, which savors more of early uf. work. There is

robe sure enough similarity to Euthymides’ style to assume that it was made lm ‘b

’ by some one working under his influence, but toattribute it to his hand
is impossible.

The refutation of c is somewhat difficult, lor it must be admitted
that at first sight it seems to show all the characteristics ol Euthymides;
a certain comparison also exists between the figures on the reverse and
those of D and E. Nevertheless Ι agree with Jones in assigning this to
Phintias, sor not only is the similarity between the figure ol Apollo here and
those os Apollo on the Corneto Amphora²9 of Phintias and Theseus on d
which may be attributed to Phintias, extraordinarily marked, but there are
important differences in technique and style from Euthymides’ work. In
the 'first' place the employment ol the ‘Buckellb'ckchen' is foreign to Euthy-

mides, norare the profiles here such as he uses. On no vase ol Euthia

mides do we find such a carelul delineation ol the feet and ankles as we
see here. General divergence ol style however is ol more weight. The
action is lar more animated, the design has more lile, and the proportion
ol the figures better and truer to nature. The artist by a delicate little
twist of the lower lolds of Leto's garment has managed to take away the

· effect of absolute inertia, and the same may be said of Apollo’s chlamys,

in the way it falls over his arm.

1 will not go so lar as to agree with Jones and assign dto Phin-
thias, but to simply relute the idea that it belongs to Euthymides. The
plate in the Monumenti is very bad and Ι have unfortunately not been able

28 Klein I think gives the wrong interpretation (Euphroni0s2 p. 265). Euthymides
signs on B “erpone εὖγε ναῖχι”, but “xurpdrm vul Ευθυμίδης” cannot be considered as ᾗ
self praise any more than “τοιτήνδε Ευθυμὶδης.”
