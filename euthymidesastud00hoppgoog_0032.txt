to examine the vase. Then, too, the vase has been cleverly restored (as
was pointed out by Petersen) and the plate is thus deceptive. But there
need be no hesitation in our resuting this vase; it certainly shows none
oi the main characteristics ol Euthymides, hb treatment of drapery, build
ol ligures, profiles, detail lines &c We have I think now obtained a clear
enough idea ol Euthymides' style to reject with certainty a vase like this.
My only excuse sor treating the vase at all, must be that the common
attribution demands a refutation.

· That I have not treated these lour vases, in my refutation of them,
at greater length, may be pardoned me, considering thatin so doingI am
merely agreeing with opinions already expressed. The evidence here is
also negative and does not advance us in our study of Euthymides. Ishall
therefore pass on to the consideration os those vases, unsigned to be sure,
which in my opinion may savely be assigned to him.

The vases I shall discuss in Part ΙΙΙ may be termed a survival of the
fittest, as I have been obliged to consider a large number which Ι have
not cited at all. I might lengthen the list with many vases which show
some slight connection with Euthymides' style, butI have made it the
rule to act on a thoroughly conservative basis and cite those only which
Ihave convinced myself are lrom the hand of our artist. Although Ι have
tried to make this list as complete as possible, Ι am conscious that a
number ol vases may still have escaped my notice. Undoubtedly there
exist in some os the smaller European Museums, which as yet Ι have
been unable to visit, other vases by him unnoticed and unpublished up
to the present moment.
