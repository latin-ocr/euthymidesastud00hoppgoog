3. Flower wreath. Worn by youths on Β4

Iu close conneen'on with 3 must the wreath on I [fig. 11] be considered.
sinoe it is really the sarno only slightly more developed. Both are extremely
rare and save that we find the flower brznch
similar ‘⁰Jv used¹ not as a wreath, but
carried in the hand7 on a kylix by Hieron
in Berlin (Gerbard, Trinkschalen und Gen-use
pl. 11, 12) and worn as a wreath on d, 1
know of .no case of its use except by
Phintias. We find him employing it on a,
while 3 may be found on c.

We have a mythological scene and.
on the reverse, what may be termed its rig. ιι.
complirnent Theseus is carrying away Helena.
and restrained hy Korone, while his friend Perithous is evidently standing
guard. That the artist has confused the inscriptionsn is apparent at once
for the subject intended was the rape of Helena, without doubt. That
the two women on the reverse are hastening to her aid is probable from
the inscription Antipeia³⁴ as well as the χαῖρε θήσευς, the extra χ being
of course a mistake. For the inscription εἰδὸνθεμεν 1 can give no inter-
pretat-iem it is probably nonseuse. The name Ηρες is also difficolt.
Gerhard and Lenormant before him had tried to read Ἥρη, but what
her significante in this soene is, does not seem apparent. We rnight
consider it as a Love name ³⁵

Careful and painstaking though the work is, yet its effect is abso-
lutely dead and there is little to adrnire save its technical skill⁴

III, IV and V form a little group by themselves and may well be
considered immediately aster 1. The absolute similarity which we saw on
the previous amphora is not so marked hut still 1 feel convinced that ΠΙ
and V may be attributed to Euthymidesl⁶ and IV partially so with a fair
amount of certainty. Cecil Smith has described them all in his catalogue
