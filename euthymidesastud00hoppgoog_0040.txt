as “style ol Phintias”. Now in the case ol IV it may be noticed that there
isa great divergence in style between obverse and reverse, the tormer
being better in execution, and the figures stronger, better proportioned
and less stereotyped than those on the reverse. General consensus ol
opinion, while assigning the obverse, and rightly I think, to Phintias, has
passed over the reverse which is not'Phintias' style at all. The theory
has occurred to me that we may here reconcile the difference in styles by
assigning the obverse to Phintias, but the reverse to Euthymides. Though
no such case has yet been found on a signed vase, this theory is not so
radical as it would seem as first sight, and is rather supported by many
laets. Klein³⁷ enumerates the different ways in which partners signed their
work and although the instances of the potter and the artists signatures
together are common enough, no instance occurs oi two men signing the
separate parts os a vase with ἔγραψε. We see however that in sculpture
two artists signed their names to their work, each probably having an
equal share (e. g. Mikkiades and Archermos³⁸‚ Kritios and Nesiotes³9 &c.&c.)
and we may say, almost with certainty, that we have a case similar to
ours on vases. The kylix in the British Museum, E, 12⁴⁰, bears on its
soot the signature ol Pamphaios. Klein⁴¹ and Hartwig⁴² who supports him,
while admitting that the inside picture is srom Pamphaios’ hand give the
outside to Euphronios⁴³, and I leel inclined to agree with them. Our theory
is thus seen to be supported by fairly tangible proof and does not rest
entirely on its own legs. Let us now contrast the two sides more in de·
tail. The heads of Apollo and Herakles are rounder and luller than those
of the reverse figures and the profiles are different. The Buckellbckchen
on the laces of all the figures of the obverse are more characteristic of
Phintias than Euthymides. ls this side be compared with the Corneto
amphora, the resemblance is striking, especially in the heads.44

ol those broad spaces and saintet detail lines on the himatia.
