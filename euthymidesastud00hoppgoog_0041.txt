Tuming to the reverse however we find the figures decidedly in
Euthymides' style, misser, more elongated less lilelike. We see the same
tendency to broad spaces ol drapery with saintet lines. The Scythian here
isa duplicate ol the one on the reverse ol D, boW, axe, shield, spear
and all, save that on D the shield has a key pattern. F urthermore we
have met the figure os the old man several times before. The dog is a
new feature but we shall find him again on other vases. He seems to be·
long to the class ol dogs commonly found on vases ol this period which
were chiefly used lor hunting⁴⁵ and whose cousins the Lacedaemoniam hounds
enjoyed a high reputation among the ancients. The warrior resembles
strongly the youth on the Psiax alabastron in Odessa⁴⁶. The warrior here
however is adjusting his helmet on his head and not raising it as on the
alabastron47. That the inscriptions on the reverse are senseless, need not
trouble us as we sound the same on Ι. The whole reverse is in lact a
mere duplicate ol III. The mythological interest is not very striking, and
offers no especial new feature, but is quite the stereotyped⁴⁸ representation
of the tripod-contest met with so often in b. f. andr. l. work. On the
whole the vase is nota very good piece of work and shows a consider-
able falling off when compared with D, E, and the Corneto amphora.
But this lact is not a weapon against our argument for there are in
existence many vases signed by the same artist which show adecided
difference in technical skill (e. g. the Petersburg psykter and the Munich
kylix of Euphronios).

The palmettes, b. l.‚ are addorsed in chain on the upper border.

Sides ol obverse are a key pattern and the bottom border is b. f. pal-
mettes ol the common type, laid however on their side. The sides and
lower border ol the reverse are similar to the lower border of the

obverse.
III is extremely like the preceding vase, though somewhat inferior in

execution. Both sides however show a unity os style we failed to find
in IV. The obverse as I have said is practically a duplicate ol the re-
