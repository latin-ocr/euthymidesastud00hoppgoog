verse oi IV with oi course a certain amount oi variation. Apart from a
slight divergence the upper palmette border suggests that on the obverse
oi D. The attitude oi the old man is admirably suited to express re·
'flection5 he seems to be gazing pensively at the dog, who belongs to the
same breed as the one we met before. The whole scene however presents
little that is striking.

On the reverse we have a subject new to usin Euthymides’ work,
a kitharist and two ephebi. The ephebus on thel. is to all intents a
clothed duplicate ol the corresponding figure on the reverse of D. The
other presents a curious feature in the way the l. hand appears as a
spiral through the drapery. A similar instance occurs on a kylix in the
British Museum‚⁴9 with the Love name Epidromos, assigned by Hartwig
to Kachrylion. As this kylix antedates Euthymides' work, this motive can
not be original with him. The kitharist in the centre might be Apollo,
but there are no inscriptions to affirm this, nor are the surroundings exactly
in keeping with him.

On the obverse os V we have a similar scene, save that here Apollo
is present between his mother and sister. He himself reminds us of the
kitharist on the former vase. Artemis holds her drapery- in the same way
as the r. h. figure on the obverse oi Ι. How common a motive this
was may be seen at a glance, from the female figures in the Acropolis
Museum. She is distinguished by her garb at huntress. Leto is no new
introduction; the whole scene, in lact, is merely a repetition⁵⁰ of what we
find on any number of b. f. vaseS.

We find as a new feature of our artist’s work the deer and the*
panther, the former as an attribute of Apollo⁵¹, the latter oi Artemis though
this case is somewhat unusual. We find the panther commonly on-b. f.
vases either with Dionysos or Athena, in the Bacchic sense, its presence
here is evidently intended to characterise Artemis as the hunting goddess
It is a curious lact that in vase painting ol this period, the artistS, while
able to ioreshorten the human figure with a sair amount ol accuracy, ,sailed
utterly when they tried to treat animals in a similar iaslrion. The panther’s
. head, so common on Korinthian aryballi is really better drawn than the
one on this vase. Still the attempt is noteworthy.
