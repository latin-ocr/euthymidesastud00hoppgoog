As faras stylistic comparison goes, we have little difficulty in attrib-
uting this to Euthymides; the shape oi the figures, profiles, technical de·
tails, fall and scheme of drapery &c δια, all point to him as the artist,
though the execution leaves much to be desired.

The reverse is more interesting and the execution better. Though
the stylistic features all point to Euthymides, the composition is more
vigorous As the artist was here dealing with naked figure, his fore·
shortening was more successful, and is, in fact, extremely good, especially
in the treatment of the heels. I admit that the composition reminds us
very strongly of the reverse ofc which Ι assigned to Phintias, but the
general style does not allow us to attribute this to him, and moreover
we may find comparisons in the figures of the reverse of E, the figure of
Theseus on I and the pose of Hektor's head on D and E. The youth
in the centre has evidently taken up the akontion from the ground and is
preparing to throw it. There is a similar figure on apsykter⁵² in the
Bourguignon collection in Naples. 1 think however that Hauser is wrong
in 'declaring that the youth there is using his pole for the purpose of
leaping. I admit that considered with reference to modern times, it
suggests the action of pole-vaulting much more than hurling. But the
former was unknown to the Greeks; at least we have no evidence that it
ever existed, while hurling the javelin⁵³ waS, as every one knows, a favorite
form of amusement, and a part of the pentathlon. The similar figure on
the Munich kylix⁵4 cited by Hauser could never have jumped with his
pole, if he adopted tlzat attitude‚ while for picking up the pole, as Ι can
attest from my 'own experience at the sport, the attitude is perfectly
appropriate. We found the discus thrower on D, but not the boxer with
his cestus.

Of the two names, Ladamas refers presumably to the Javelin thrower
and Phayllos⁵⁵ to the discobolus The former⁵⁶ so far as I know occurs
here for the first and only time Wernicke⁵7 is perfectly right in assuming
that it is not used here with Καλός. The name oi Phayllos is significant,
