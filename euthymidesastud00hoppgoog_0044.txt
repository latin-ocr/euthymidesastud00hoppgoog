not only because we have also found Euthymides using it (Β. and D.)
where it also refers to the discobolos but as another point in showing the
connection between him ¹and Phintias. The same name occurs on the
Bourguignon psykter already mentioned, which Hauser is right in assigning

‘ to Phintias, though'I fail to see the contrast between this psykter and c

which we have already assigned to the same artist. But Ι do not think
that his identification ol PhaylloS, although suggested as a pure possibility,
is tenable. Hc supposes it to have been the name ol a Pentathlos of
Kroton‚ and as he follows Kretschmer’s view as to Phintias’ origin, he
thinks there may have been an intimate connection between the two. But
we have assumed to Phintias a residence in Athens, even is his origin be
, Dorian, and there is certainly no means lor tracing the connection, il any,
between the Athlete and Euthymides, so that the name must sor the
present remain unidentified. But it is valuable ior our argument to find
another case os the two artists using the same name.

We find the pubes on the akontion thrower indicated in the same ·

fashion as those on the naked figures on E. The palmette borders are
here treated in a new way, b. on r. and placed on their sides.

Π is an amphora which naturally follows the three just considered.
Hartwig however has assigned it to Amasis II butl see no reason to
change my original view. I had caused this vase as well as its companion
No 302 (Hartwig op. cit. p. 414) to be specially photographed, buta very
short study ol the same convinced me that the two were certainly not
from the same hand, and in lact show a very dissimilar style. Although
Hartwig has done great service in determining Amasis' style from very
scanty materials‚ I fail to see how our vase agrees with it, lor it differs
srom the Munich amphora 411, (which, though unsigned, ¹is an excellent

specimen ol Amasis’ work) in almost every respect, the only similariry=

being as sar as I can discover, between the heads of the female figures

on the obverse ol our vase and that of the Munich amphora. Ι will admit ’

that the drapery treatment here, is not precisely identical with what we
already distinguished as Euthymidean, in that it shows no use ol sainter
lines in the clriton and a lack of broad spaces in the himation. But if it
does not coincide with our artist's treatment, it most certainly is not similar
to the drapery on Munich 411, so that point cannot be used in its behall.
But in other characteristics, the build ol the figures, profileS, composition &c
it is thoroughly in Euthymides' style. From a comparison os ΠΙ and
