IV, 1 should interpret the subject as the warriors' departure, not as Ger·
hard supposes, his return, and the sacrifice to speed him on his way has
just been completed. This however is a significant point and will be
discussed later. We find both the others similarly treated, a Scythian⁵⁸,
or an old man, a youth in armor and a male or female figure, all forming

a coherent group3 here as on E we have a female figure. Variety has
been attained by the introduction of the sacrifice motive and the dog.
That animal is the same asin III and V, but here the artist has made
an astonishing advance in that he has attempted to foreshorten the dog
from behind. That he has failed amounts to nothing; the boldness of the
attempt is the really striking thing about it.

Save the Scythian, none of the figures present any peculiarity; the.
helmet laps over into the pattem (a similar one to that on C and
the reverse os 1) as we found it doing in E, 111 and IV. The attitude
of the Scythian is the same as that of Priam on E and the old man
on Ι. We found the same enclosing side pattern on 111 save that here it
isr. f.

The reverse represents a revel and suggests at once the similar scene
on the reverse of E. All the figures here are naked and that of the flute
girl is especially noteworthy, for it shows all the defects of the cycle,
when the question of drawing a naked female figure was concemed, but
as in the case ol the dog, the foreshortening is singulary ambitious, and the
swing of the revellers is rather better than we have found in our artist's work
before. The breasts are placed at right angles to the body. while the shape of
the body below thern might do as well for a youth no attempt being
made to emphasise the swelling of the hips. The pubes is here indicated
as on E and V. No attempt is made to reproduce the abdominal museleS,
but as this lack of detail we found already on C, its absence need not
weaken our arguments as to the authorship of this vase. A komos is a
favorite subject at this period, not only being common on b. f. work, but
also in the work of Duris, Hieron and Brygos. No Bacchic significance
of course can be attached to this, save the probable fact that all the
figures, especially theone on the l. are intoxicated. A similar pithos may

5⁸ This costume is a striking one and differs altogether from theton ΠΙ. Α similar
costuma occurs on the inside of a kylix in the British Museum, E51, assigned by Hart-
wig to Euphronios (op. cit. pl. XIII. cf. also Gerhard, A. V. 167). Both these vases are
of a later date; 1 have been unable to find any earlier instance.
