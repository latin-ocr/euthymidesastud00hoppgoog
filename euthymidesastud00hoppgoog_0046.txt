be found on another vase attributed to Phintias⁵⁹. The vase on the whole
does not impress us with any strong originality either in conception or
execution.

I feel constrained to add VI to the list though it cannot be classed
on the same plane with D and E. I have little hesitation in assigning it
to Euthymides but the restoration of the vase in many places rather tends
to weaken our impression. Roulez declares that all the restorations‚ ex-
cept on the belly of the r. h. female figure, follow the lines of the older
drawing. Ι have not seen the vase and cannot speak authoritively on this
subject, but the face on the same figure, as it now is, cannot possibly be
correct. It was drawn originally “en sace'’ undoubtedly, but at present is
’ in a style quite foreign to our artist. What the subject represents 1 can·
not say; Roulez interprets it as the contest between Lycurgus or Tydeus
and Amphiaraos, one of the old Thebaid legends. I do not see however
that it avails us much, to discuss this point, since to declare the subject
as “heroic'’ is quite sufficient for our purpure. The reverse offers no
'new treatment of the motive but has its principal interest in the fact
that the heroic subject of the obverse is not here balanced by a gymnastic
or revelling scene. By stretching a point one might consider this in the
light of a komoS, but that is doubtful. A later development of Euthy-
mides’ work may perhaps exist here, since Bacchic soenes are commoner
in the Euphronian than the Epiktetan cycle.

Certain points in the treatment must be noticed. All the technical
details as well as the stylistic features I have tried to establish may be
found here and 1 may save myself the trouble of repeating them.6⁰ What
chiefly strikes our attention is the boldness of the foreshortening. The
r. h. male figure is of course a copy of the figure of Phayllos on B and

. the middle figure on the reverse of I, the other male figure not being

drawn as well. That Euthymides has tried to draw the human face from
the front is an advance. As I have said, the restoration presents our
deciding how far he has succeeded, but the fact alone is significant. We
saw how poorly the dog on ll was drawn and although we have a human
face, we may assume the result was far from satisfactory. The figure as
a whole we found before on the same vase. Instances of the human face

⁶0 The treatment of the drapery differs slightly, but we found such to be the case
on II; the other features are all present.
