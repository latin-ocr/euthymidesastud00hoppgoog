in direct foreshortening are by no means common before Euthymides time.
The Gorgoneion, so common on b. f. kylices‚ was if we may consider it
'as a human face, the earliest effort. As an actual case of its treatment
with regard to a human body, the figure of Dionysos on the Franeois
Vase may well be the earliest instance. Its use throughout b. f. work is
not so common (cf. Gerhard, Α. V. 227). Andokides was the firstto
employ it in r. f. work (cf. Berlin amphora 2159). Until Euphronios'
time artists did not employ it much, as the results were evidently too un·
satisfactory. Accordingly during the Epiktetan cycle we find few instances
of its occurrence (cf. A. V. 51, 5), but after Euphronios‚ the artists were
able to handle it more skilfully, so much so that they made the next pro-
’ gression into representing the face three-quarters view.

The helmets lap over the pattern as we have seen before on other
vases. The hair-dressing of thel. h. female figure is similar to that of
the figures on I. The lower palmette border is the same as in E, while
the sides and that above are identical with those of II save that here we
have the side border r. f. instead of b. f.

VII has been assigned to Euthymedes by general consent and little
need be said in addition. The vase as now set up in the British Museum >
has had the restorations removed⁶¹. A comparison ·of the heads of the
figures here and those of the figures onE afford a striking similarity‚ the
wreaths also being identical with those worn by the same figures and the
Paidotribes on D. The build of the figures drawing of details scheme
of drapery are all characteristic. Iam in doubt as to which period of
Euthymides' work to assign this vase; the general effect suggests the

, ’ earlier, but the introduction of hair on the breast seems a rather later

 

characteristic.

The inscriptions are interesting, but to attempt the identification of
the names here with personages as Jahn has done seems to me not only
impossible but unnecessary. His, at all events are certainly uncorrect.
That the rest of the inscription is a self laudatory one κάρτα δικαίως and
χαῖρε (to translate freely “that's something like’' and “hurrah”) a com-
parison with B shows. But I do not agree with Klein in his conclusion
from a, b, and I, that they are used in the same way on those vases as
here. Ihave already shown the impossibitity of considering the inscrip-
