tions on a and b in anything but adedicatory sense. Moreover the χαῖρε
on Ι is addressed to Theseus. This is the third case of self adulation
(B and E) 3ηά it is fair to assume that if among the limited number of
vases we have already from his hand, so large a proportion show this
Ι same peculiarity, the proportiou would hold true in all his other works
which we do not know.

VIII is another vase generally assigned to Euthymides and justly
so. It is in lactan extremely good specimen of our artist at his best.
Not only does the inscription Λέαγρος καλός, which 1 discussed before
give us an approximate date, but shows that the beginning of Euphro-
nios’ career was synchronous with Euthymides at the height of his activity.
If we contrast this vase with B which may possibly belong to our artist's
early period, it can easily be seen what a difference exists between the
two. Not but that the same hand is prominent in¹ both, for in the krater
the figures, especially the ones in rest are stereotyped and conventional
to the last degree, 3ηά the usual characteristics, build of body, profiles,
curling fingers, foreshortening, stiff drapery 3ηά bad drawing (e. g. boy
on upper r. h. [plate in Arch. leit] and youth pouring oil on his arm)
are apparent at a glance. But here we have a freer use of the faint de-
tail lines, more figures introduced and more foreshortemng. The discobolus
we met before (D 3ηά V) while Lykos is almost a duplicate of Hektor
on D and E. Hippomedon suggests the central figure on the reverse
of E.

Besides Leagros‚ we have the Love-name of Hipparchos, a character-
istic one of Epiktetos' cycle, 3ηά Lykos a name used by Euphronios
and Onesimus on the Troilus kylix in Perugia⁶² and Onesimos on a kylix
in Louvre⁶³. All these names strengthen our dating the krater as a work
of Euthymides' maturity. The ephebus anointing himself is not a new
motive, but was used by Psiax before him on the Karlsruhe alabastron⁶⁴
The representation of the actual process of infibulation⁶⁵ is extremely
curious, though men and animals similarly adorned are by no means rare.
The peculiar form of the pubes is similar to that on the reverse of E.
On the whole the vase is 3 work of the highest excellence in technique
