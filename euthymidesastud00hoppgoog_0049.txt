and spirit and must be reckoned as one of the best of those vases we
assign to Euthymides

I regret that I have been unable personally to examine IX for the
drawing in the Anzeiger is extremely small and unsatisfactory. To judge
from the description of the hydria as well as the drawing I consider
P. Herrmann right in assigning it to Euthymides. The form of the
hydria is analogous to that of C, and the palmette decoration is the
same as on several of his vases Moreover as Hermann truly remarks,
Euthymides is the only one, so far as we know, of those artists who
wrote Λέαγρος καλός on their vases, who made hydrias. F urther the figure
with the akontion resembles very closely the similar figure on IV. Her-
mann‘s enumeration of characteristic details seem ro justify his argument
perfectly, and I shall save myself the trouble of¹ repeating them.

As a last work, X, Ι mention the acropolis pinax. Jones⁶⁶ has already
ventured the assumption that it might be a work from Euthymides' hand
and Ι agree with him in thinking so. lt is of course true that no case
has yet been proved where a vase painter also made pinakes, but pinakes
have been found on the Acropolis with the signature of their makers.⁶⁷
In the first place the present pinax⁶⁸ shows decided traces of Euthymides
style, in the profile, foreshortening, faint detail lines (e. g. the line down
the centre of the back) and conventionality of treatment. The helmet to
be sure is an Attic one, while all the helmets we have found so far in
our artist's work are Korinthian‚ but this fact in itself is not a sufficient
argument against our theory. The border of the head piece however is iden·
tical with that on the helmet on E, and further as a sign of Euthymides'
tendency to reduplicate various motives the Seilenos on the shield is
exactly like that on the shield of the Scythian on D, with a slight varia-
tion in the pose of the arm. Ι make this ascription of the pinax to Euthy-
mides, however, with a certain reserve in the absence of any certain proof
that pinakes were ever made by vase painters. Ι

We have thus obtained for our artist atotal of fourteen⁶9 vases,

68 The pinax to be sure is decidedly in the style of the Epiktetan cycle, but this in
itself is no argument against it considering that we have shown Euthymides’ connection

with that eriod.
