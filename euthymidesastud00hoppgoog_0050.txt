eight amphoras (D, E, 1, ΙΙ, ΙΙΙ, IV, V, Vl), two hydrias (C, IX), two
psykters (B, Vll), a krater (VIII), and a plate (l), besides a pinax, It
may here be noticed that Euthymides‘ figures as an amphora painter for
the most part. lt is extraordinary that no kylix⁷⁰ has yet been found
which can be assigned to him. Ι have seen several which bore a certain
similarity to his style, but it has proved impossible, after a carelul analysis
of them, to assign them to him. The list of our vases is to be sure a
small one, but 1 have no doubt that it will be increased in time. lt must
be remembered that this number forms but a very small amount of the

vases Euthymides undoubtedly made, and cannot, in any sense of the ·

word, be called a complete one. lt is to be hoped that further excava-
tions in Italian tombs will bring some more of his work to light.

Now having thoroughly analysed Euthymides‘ work, both signed and
unsigned, we are in a position to investigate more closely the composition
and subject-matter of his pictures The following table will present the
summary in its most compact form. ·

Α. One figure ........... Heroic

Two figures (A) ......... Mythological
' n u (B) ......... Gymnastic
u .......... Symposium
b (A) ......... Heroic

im Museum zu Turin‚ crhalte ich von J. E. Hatrison Mittheilung. doch ohne nihere Angabe
des Gegenstandes.” 1 have been unable to trace this vase in any way, but from the
general uncertainty which prevails‚ with regard to Euthymides style, lsbould feel. inclined
to doubt this vase, especially as it has never been published, which I am sure Miss
Harrlson would have done, had she felt absolutely certain on the subject.
