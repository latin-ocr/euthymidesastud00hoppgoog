Out of twenty-five pictures we obtain the following: 11330108, Mytho·
logical 5, Gymnastic 6, Komastic 4, Symposium and Bacchic each 1.
Ι have adopted the term ‘heroic’, for though no distinct character can be
attributed to A and X, they are certainly not ‘genre‘ pictures. In the
case of ‘mythological’ Ι have applied it only to those scenes which are
really mythical, such as groups of divinities and scenes from the lives of
all the mythical heroes as Herakles, Theseus &c

We find the pictores generally combined in such a way that a mytho-
logical scene has for its comphment a heroic or gymnastic one, while the
heroic, when used as the obverse, is balanced by a gymnastic scene or
komos on the reverse. F urther the number of figures on the amphora is
never more than five or less than three. And this fact shows as forcibly
as anything can do so, that Euthymides is no follower of the Euphronian
cycle. Throughout the periods of Andokides, Exekias and Epiktetos we
see a fondness for mythological and gymnastic scenes, expressed by a
small amount of figures. The Euphronian cycle discarded the amphora
with its small number of figures and developed the kylix which afforded
free play for a large number of figures. And along with the developement
of the kylix came an increasing enthusiasm for purely ‘genre' pictures, a
feature quite foreign to Euthymides’ work,⁷¹ for the Symposium, which is
