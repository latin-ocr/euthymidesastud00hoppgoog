the only one of his pictures which might be considered as such, is really
not a ‘genre' picture at all, but was already used in the Epiktetan cycle.
(v. Klein, Euphron.² p. 123.) The Euphronian cycle still uses mytho·
logical soenes, but as it developes we find that scenes taken from the
market, the shop, the bath, the palaestra and Love·scenes are all the
rage. Phintias, it is true, employs these types72, but his partner does not
seem to have followed his example.

Ι Symmetry and balance are two qualities displayed in a marked degr'ee
by our artist. While a characteristic feature, throughout Greek ceramic
art, Ι know of no artist who has them morekeen and true than Euthy·
mides. Not only are all his figures drawn with due regard to the shape
of the vase, but almost every line has its compliment. As in pediment
groups, the action of every picture leads up to a central point, and there
is little desire to present on the same vase a series of groups each of
which is sufficient to itself. Vlll is perhaps the only case where this
occure, but even then the picture forms a harmonious whole. No greater
contrast can be found than in Douris’ or Brygos’ work, where we often
find a series of detached groupS, which do not go to make up a whole.
A study of vase painting from this standpoint would be extremely in-
structive and I regret that lack of space prevents my treating it at the
length it deserves.

The subject matter of the pictures has been discussed already in
most of the vaseS, but Ι have reserved for the end, an analysis of the
motive of the warriors departure, which forms the favorite subject of our
artist, in that it occurs no less than five times (D, E, ΙΙ, ΙΙΙ and IV) out
of eight heroic pictures. Although the underlying idea is the same in all,
yet we find variatione of the theme, and may thus divide the pictures into
three groups, 1. (D and E) the preliminary action of putting on the armor,

2 (ΙΙΙ and IV) the warrior standing ready, and 3 (II) the farewell sacri-
fice and libation.

Of all the subjects which may be classed as “heroic’'‚ there is none
in Greek vase painting more popular than this, and though treated in many
ways falls naturally under two heads the warrior standing surrounded
by his family or friends, and the warrior departing in his chairot. Itis,
of course, with the first only that we have to deal. How and where the
