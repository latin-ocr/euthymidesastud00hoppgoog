motive originated is difficult to say; perhaps the earliest idea might ’
be found on the well-known Mycenean Warrior Vase, which is certainly
a representation of warriors departing for war, though not conceived in
precisely the same way as the theme we are diseussing. In the Dipylon
style it does not exist at all, and it is doubtful whether it occurs on any
Korinthian vase⁷³. On a Chalcydian kylix (A. V. 190, 191) the arming
aud departing motives are introduced, while the warrior adjusting his
greaves, between a man and a woman, can be found on a tripod vase
from Nola (Gerhard, Etrus and Camp. Vasenb. pl. 13, 5). Itis on the
early Attie amphoras however that we find the theme introduced with all
possible variations. The simplest form is a warrior with shield and spear
standing between an old man and a youth (Mus. Greg. II pl. 612a); also
we have aScythian archer, a very common motive, introduced (Brit, Mus.
E. 246 cf. A. V. 119 8). A woman frequently occurs (Arch. Zeit. 1861
pl. 156) while two warriors (one an archer) are often represented side by
side (A. V. 265). On the last we find the dog, a favorite companion of
the warrior, as we found him on 11, Ill and IV.

The arming motive presents a new feature in that the act of adjusting

⁹ the cuirass is represented. Ihave been unable to find any case of its

occurrence on b. f. work, and in fact are aware of only one other instance,

on a r. f. kylix of later date (A. V. 269, 270). The motive of adjusting
the greaves is extremely common. We must therefore attribute the in-
vention of the former motive to our artist. The addition of names to
represent an actual heroic scene, is more peculiar to r. f. than b. f. work.

11 contains the most interesting scene of all, the farewell sacrifice and
libation. The sacrificial entrails are brought to the warrior to taste while
his wife holds the bowl ready for the libation. That such libations were
common from the earliest times we learn from the Iliad 24, 283. Curiously
enough this libation theme never occurs on b. f. vases, but seems to have
been an innovation of r. f. artists We cannot assign this invention to
Euthymides since it also occurs on the Amasis' amphora (Munich 411)
which is of about the same date as 11. But the motive of examining the
entrails is not only an original motive with Euthymides but is also parti-
culary unique, since no similar case occurs on any Greek vase.

73 The pinax in Berlin No 778 and the lekythos in the British Museum B 26, can
hardly be associated with this theme.
