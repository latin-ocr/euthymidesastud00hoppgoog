little used in the Euphronian cycle. This is not surprising since the com-
position, employing only a few figures, symmetrically arranged, was better
suited to the amphora than any other vessel, and while the amphora held
sway in the b. s. and early r. f. work, it naturally ruled with it. But the
rapid growth in favor of the kylix, to which it was thoroughly unsuited,
drove it out; perhaps its lack of the “genre'' qualities may have contri-
buted to its decline.

The study of Greek ceramic art has made wonderful progress the

stepping stones for future investigation. Ι can only hope that Ι have
succeeded in giving to Euthymides his proper position among the artists
of the late 6th and early 5th centuries, and that the results here obtained
will serve as means to the end we all have in view.

NOTE.

This article was already in press, before Idiscovered, too late to
mention it, in its proper place, that the Leyden Amphora (VI) had been

assigned by Hartwig, Meisterschalen p. 60, to Oltos. Isee no reason,
however, to change the view 1 have already expressed.
