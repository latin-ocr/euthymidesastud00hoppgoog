VITA.

l, Joseph Clark Hoppin was born on the 23d of May, 1870 in Pro-
vidence, Rhode Island, U. S. A My father, Courtland Hoppin, a physi-
cian in that city, died when 1 was six years old; my mother (born Mary
Frances Clark) is still living. In 1878 Ι went to Europe and remained
in Stuttgart for three years, being at one time a student of the Real·
Schule there. After my return to America 1 prepared for college at the
Groton School, Groton, Mass, and entered Harvard University in the
autumn of 1889, from which Universityl graduated four years later, in
1893, receiving the degree of Bachelor of Arts. While at Harvard I
devoted myself principally to the study ol Classical Philology and attended
the lectures of Professors Goodwin, Lane, Greenough, White and Wright
In the autumn of 1893 1 went to Athens where I remained for one winter
as a student at the American School, and while there attended the lectures of
Professor Richardson, the Director of the School and also of ProfessorDo'rpfeld

1stSecretary of the German Institute. ln the following spring I assisted at
the excavations at the Heraion, Argos, under the direction of Professor
Waldstein. In the summer of 18941matriculated at the University of
Berlin, as a student of archaeolo'gy and attended the lectures· of Professor
Curtius and Kekule‘, and Dr. Kalkmann. In the autumn Iwent to the

University of Munich for the two semesters of 1894-95 and studied under
Professor F urtwiingler, also attending the lectures of Professor von Christ,
Krumbacher and Oberhummer. I visited Greece for two months between
the semesterS, to take part in the last campaign at the Heraion. Having
then been assigned by Professor Waldstein the work of preparing and classi·
fying the vase fragments found at the Heraion, for the final publication, I
obtained leave of absence for the winter semester of 1895—96, from the
University of Munich, and spent the time in Athens in this work, returning
to Munich for the following summer semester.
